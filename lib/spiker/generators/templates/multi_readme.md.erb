# <%= config[:name_as_class] %> Spike

This is the auto-generated README for the <%= config[:name_as_class] %> spike.  This content was generated by the [Spiker](https://github.com/norlinga/spiker) gem.

## Getting Started

This directory is the result of **someone** running the following command on a command line:

    $ gem install spiker
    $ spiker multi <%= config[:name] %>

Now that you're here, open your favorite text editor and then execute the following command:

    $ bundle install
    $ guard

Bundler will have executed once when the spike directory was first created, but it's no problem to run it again (in case the spike directory was shared between machines / environments).

You should have been greeted with a passing tests from Guard.  You are now ready to start hashing out your spike under test.

## Adding to This README

This README could be a great place to capture findings from your spike.  Topics to address in this README might include:

- what was the initial motivation for this spike?
- what is the current state of this spike?
- is there a future intention or unrealized goal for this spike?
- what was discovered in the course of this spike?
- who is involved in this spike?

## Feel Free to Include Code

Embedding code in a Markdown file is easy, using the triple backtick syntax.  The following code will be rendered as a Ruby code block:

```ruby
require 'dotenv'

puts ENV["TEST_VALUE"]

"maybe show some code in your README?".capitalize
```

Spikes are intended to be thrown away, but that doesn't mean they have to be conducted poorly during their short lives...
